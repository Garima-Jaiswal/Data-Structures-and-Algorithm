# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. This are solutions of some questions to enhance problem-solving skills.

<h4>Data Structures</h4>
The following data structures are implemented in this project:
<ul>
  <li><b>Arrays :</b>Basic operations and manipulations.</li>
  <li><b>Linked Lists :</b> Singly and doubly linked lists with basic operations.</li>
  <li><b>Stacks :</b> Implementation of stack using arrays and linked lists. </li>
  <li><b>Queues :</b> Implementation of queue using arrays and linked lists, including circular queues.  </li>
  <li><b>Hash Tables :</b> Basic implementation of hash tables with collision handling.</li>
  <li><b>Trees :</b> Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and more.</li>
  <li><b>Heaps :</b> Binary heaps and their applications.</li>
  <li><b>Graphs :</b> Representation and traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS).</li>
</ul>
