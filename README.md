# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. This are solutions of some leetcode questions to enhance problem-solving skills.

<h4>Data Structures</h4>
The following data structures are implemented in this project:

Arrays: Basic operations and manipulations.
Linked Lists: Singly and doubly linked lists with basic operations.
Stacks: Implementation of stack using arrays and linked lists.
Queues: Implementation of queue using arrays and linked lists, including circular queues.
Hash Tables: Basic implementation of hash tables with collision handling.
Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and more.
Heaps: Binary heaps and their applications.
Graphs: Representation and traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS).
