# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. This are solutions of some leetcode questions to enhance problem-solving skills.

<h4>Data Structures</h4>
The following data structures are implemented in this project:
<ul>
  <li>Arrays: Basic operations and manipulations.</li>
  <li>Linked Lists: Singly and doubly linked lists with basic operations.</li>
  <li>Stacks: Implementation of stack using arrays and linked lists. </li>
  <li>Queues: Implementation of queue using arrays and linked lists, including circular queues.  </li>
  <li>Hash Tables: Basic implementation of hash tables with collision handling.</li>
  <li>Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and more.</li>
  <li>Heaps: Binary heaps and their applications.</li>
  <li>Graphs: Representation and traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS).</li>
</ul>
