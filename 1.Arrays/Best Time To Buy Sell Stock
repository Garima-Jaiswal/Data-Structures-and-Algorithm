You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int bp= Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit= 0;

        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
            if(bp<prices[i]){
                int profit= prices[i]-bp;
                maxProfit= Math.max(maxProfit,profit);
            }else{
                bp=prices[i];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;     
    }
}
